#### What is Nikto?

***Nikto is open source web application scanner and if you see any port open related to web, you can  trigger nikto for scanning.***

Nikto is one of the open source utilities that is broadly utilized by Pentesters for quick and automated web application vulnerability scanning. 

Nikto has the ability to detect possibly fascinating threats by referencing the robots.txt file, by spidering the outside of the application, 
and by going through a rundown of known documents that might contain interesting data.

***Nikto performs more than 6700 tests against a site.***

The vast number of tests for both security vulnerabilities and mis-configured web servers makes it a go to device for most of the security experts and pentesters. 

Nikto can be used to test a Web Site and Web Server or a Virtual Host for known security vulnerabilities and mis-configurations of files, programs and servers. 

It can discover overlooked contents or scripts and other difficult to identify issues from an outside point of view.
